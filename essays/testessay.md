*Intentions for the future*

## What is the point of anything?

In this day and age motivation is a key ingredient in progress and work. It's not enough to simply do or not do, as now 'why' or 'why not' have had plenty of time to edge in and become just as vital questions. Of course this is a subjective assessment, but subjectivity is inevitable. Despite potentially adding extra complexity to decisionmaking, often 'why' may simply be as simple as an absence of a 'why not'! They say that you should shoot for the moon, since if you miss then at least you'll land among the stars. This is a simple enough reason for a lofty, likely unattainable goal.

## The Big Ask

My goals in the field of computer science involve attaining and utilizing proficiency in machine learning and artificial intelligence. The ultimate goal is to apply these principles in tandem with neuroscience in the pursuit of novel development of potential artificial general intelligence applications. Further study of other high level scientific fields could offer more wholistic or unified understanding, or broaden the scope of applicability of developed models. Of course this is a vague roadmap, but better a lengthy checklist that's yet to be fully broken down than nothing in the hand!

## Base level applications?

The novel concept of a neural-computer interface once was a mere science-fiction concept, but in the wake of the Neuralink human trial it's safe to say that the future is now. Though the patient whom received the implant has since lost functionality as in line with projected expectations, it's fair to say that the concept has experienced it's "Kitty Hawk moment". The root concept is sound, and thus the sky is once again the limit.

## Managing Expectations 

While it is good exercise in ambition and confidence to suggest that I might be able to make strides in any cutting edge in the fields of emergent sciences, it's important to reign in my hubris lest I reach beyond my means too quickly. One might recall the story of Icarus. Regardless of whether I be the first to explore these frontiers of discovery, being knowledgable enough to parse studies by contemporaries and even contribute to their work is nothing to sneeze at.
