## Initial Thoughts

While my kneejerk impression for Typescript may be one of mute disappointment in needing to learn yet *another* version of a coding language, it's important to have a versatile understanding of various coding practices. To that point Typescript seems highly accessible as it's a language used through browser interfaces rather than dedicated IDEs so it's easy to pick-up-and-play in a sense. This nature seems to make the practice viable in remote work applications. One of the greatest positive factors to using Typescript is the apparent forgiving nature of the language. It's clear that my understanding is entry level (as well it should be!) yet I am able to omit snippets of code that the teacher has been writing in their samples, to little detriment. It's clear that my coding skills/habits from other languages are carrying me thus far, which is just as much as I could hope for! It's encouraging that my core competency in coding is readily transferrable with Typescript.


## WOD related

```
 if (inHand<=79){
    return ("feels like "+inHand+": OK");
    } else if (inHand<=90){
    return ("feels like "+inHand+": Caution");
    } else if (inHand<=102){
    return ("feels like "+inHand+": Extreme Caution");
    } else if (inHand<=125){
    return ("feels like "+inHand+": Danger");
    }
    return ("feels like "+inHand+": Extreme Danger");
```
Notably, the preceding snippet of code was nearly identical to the one written on the spot by the teacher who proctored tonight's WOD quiz; only his version started from the top of the scale and went down. Nothing spectacular but worth a pat-on-the-back, no?

The WOD quiz this evening itself was a decent introduction to the expectations for this course. It's good that I'm needing to learn Typescript as an entire new set of knowledge and specifics to memorize, rather than just complicating previous lessons in say, Python or Java. It's my belief that broadly focused studies improve overall performance in addition to their obvious benefits.

I don't have too many more expectations other than competency and the vague expansion of my horizons, but it's refreshing to be taking multiple courses in the ICS field in tandem, even if it might not have been advisable!
