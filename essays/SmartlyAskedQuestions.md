## Is there such thing as a stupid question?
"There are no such things as stupid questions, only stupid people."
-Mr. Garrison (South Park)


Even though the essay we've been assigned to read is more than 20 years old it's uncanny just how relevant the message contained remains to this day. What's more, the 'written voice' with which the author writes is just as clear and concise as one would hope for someone teaching such matters of brevity and clarity. Truly, on my own journey in traversing the internet and communicating with other denizens therein I've previously, intuitively learned the lessons outlined in Raymond's writings. It's likely for the best that a majority of my dumb, poorly-composed queries written in my youth don't come to mind. That is to say, I get the point--but I appreciate the effort. That is also not to say that I already knew every point that was made! If anything, it's put what vague collection of understandings that I've cobbled together in an orderly system and filled in the gaps that I hadn't yet gone into at detail. In being curt yet courteous one avoids wasting anyone's time, and professionalism is often met in kind, yet it's easy to breach protocol and once that's done it's a miracle that things don't devolve into a flame war on the spot.

In reading Raymond's elaborations on the pitfalls of question-writing, I'm forced to think about the examples of poorly-thought-out 'ask's I've overheard in real life! It's strange to think that some folks might be so blissfully unaware of the strain that they might put on a person's patience inadvertently, but then I remember that the world is vast and there are so many different people that live such wildly different lives. But then again I'm quite glad that I don't have to deal with certain people! Things probably balance out in the grand scheme of things, right? Ha-ha.

In the github question at [this link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67943430/it-apparently-fails-to-find-the-module) it's not immediately apparent what the issue is, and indeed, who could possibly know what is going on? I'd say that 'apparently' is a dead giveaway here, but that sort of vague-feely reasoning isn't the best litmus test. The first issue when stepping into the question is obvious: The OP (original poster) has provided no summary of what they expect from their code, or any clues as to its function. That's right, the OP is asking anyone and everyone to read and digest their code in order to proceed to actually helping. A very steep ask indeed. One might expect every reasonable person to be filtered out by this but despite that a couple of kind souls do offer help. A suggested answer is rebuffed with equally brief links to more descriptionless chunks of text, and it's perfectly understandable that the thread went cold at that point.

The beauty of practical familiarity with the conduct as outlined in Raymond's essay is in no small part due to its utility. It's simply useful and practical to quickly get answers. 
While [this question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17/binary-data-in-mysql) is by no means a perfect question, as it is kind of wide-angled, but it is specific enough to get started with. The answer was similarly wide-facing, but given how the answer wasn't simply "RTFM", it wasn't much of an issue. In fact, there were a number of more specific potential answers offered, so all around anyone could happen upon any of the answers if they themselves were to find themselves checking the archives.

The ultimate counterpoint to the careful considerations laid out in the essay is the similarly pervasive phenomena wherein a blatantly, verifiably wrong answer is posted as given fact. This misinformation is often seen as an affront, and a knowledgable individual whom may not have been motivated to answer the question initially is spurred to providing an answer for sheer spite of the wrong answer. The nuances of the internet are truly a wonder.
